# Acme Games Corp Todo App

As an Acme Games engineer, I need to track my tasks outside of JIRA. I hate JIRA and end up tracking my work on pieces of paper that I accidentally throw away. Data is held in local storage and it should handle multiple tabs gracefully.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run e2e`

Launches end-to-end cypress tests using mock data.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
